## What is this talk?

1. Mixins
    * What problems do they address?
    * Explore the design space
1. Library Design
    * One specific set of priorities
    * Explore existing solutions.
1. Deep dive into the implementation.
1. The future

NOTES:

* Mixins -- What are they. What problem do they solve.
This is going to be a bit of a strange talk. I want to talk about mixins, what
they are. Why they're important, and how I think we should be thinking about
them.

But this is also a talk about API design. I'm going to use mixins as a case
study in design.
