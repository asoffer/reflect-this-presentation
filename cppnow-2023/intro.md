## <span style="color:#a00000;text-decoration:line-through"><span style="color:black">How I think about design.</span></span>
### <span class="edited_title">Talk outline.</span>


1. What problem are we solving, and why?
1. What are our priorities?
1. Evaluate the design space.
1. Implementation it!
1. Iteratively improve upon our design.

NOTES:

* Talk structured in the same way I think about design.
* Problem: If you can't articulate what the problem is *and* why it's a problem, you'll never convince anyone it's worth solving. -- If you're familiar with mixins, you already understand this, but bear with me.
* Priorities: Important to state explicitly. Tradeoffs.
* Evaluate: Because tradeoffs, you'll want to explore several different directions.
* Implement: Only once you understand the problem space.
* Iterate: You'll get it wrong the first try.

NOTES:

* Just the people who have contributed meaningfully to the design.
* Many others have offered improvements and bug fixes.

* Zie Weaver in particular has done a huge amount here and is responsible for the migration of an existing library to this one.
* If you didn't catch her talk yesterday, you can watch it online.
