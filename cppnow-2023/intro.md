NOTES:

* Mixins -- What are they. What problem do they solve.
This is going to be a bit of a strange talk. I want to talk about mixins, what
they are. Why they're important, and how I think we should be thinking about
them.

But this is also a talk about API design. I'm going to use mixins as a case
study in design.

If I convince you of one thing, it's that the there is a ton of fertile ground
in the design space here. In the library space, as well as at the
language-level.
